The Questions I Get
===================

I'm done with *Learn Python the Hard Way*, so what's next?

- What's a good project to build my Python skills?
- What book should I read to become a better Python Programmer?
- What's an intermediate level programmer?

----

Assumptions I Made
==================

- Familiar with the concepts in  *Learn Python the Hard Way* but not much more.

Where are we?
=============

Linear model 2 (beginner at one end and infinity at the other end)

First 5% is beginner and last 5% is expert.

My Approach to Answering the Question
=====================================

I asked several self-proclaimed and personally opinioned intermediate to expert level programmers these questions.

Responses
=========
Describe an intermediate level programmer?
------------------------------------------

- Knows most __builtins__.
- Can write clean code.
- Needs less direction than a beginner programmer but more direction than a senior programmer.

----

Responses
=========
What did you do that caused you to grow out of beginnerhood?
------------------------------------------------------------

- Review Code
- Pursue you own projects outside of work projects. 
- Learn on your own.*

- Ask questions 
  - What is more pythonic?
  - What's easier to maintain and why?
  - What would perform better?

----

My Perspective
==============
Where to go from here?
----------------------

- Create a project for your self that will stretch your skill set.
- Review code and get your code reviewed (Reviewing Buddy)
